# Choosing a topic (Voice Acting)
For this freedom project I chose a topic that contains voice acting. Since I wanna do voice acting in the future because it sounds really fun to impersonate a character you hate or love. So far I would like to make a crossover of technology we have today with voice acting. Some research I've made about it was not really easy to find but,there's a few I would like to share like "The Future of Voice Acting: AI and Technology Trends" By Voicover Kickstart, "The Evolution of Voice Acting in the Digital Era" by OutSpoken Voices, and "Unlocking Creative Potential: AI Voice Tools for Voice Actors" by Respeecher. Each one of these have in common is new technology like AI helps with people voice act more better and fluently in many ways, same with the new technology helping advance voices.

# Engineering Design Process
In this part of Edp I'm at the start of everything about my freedom project. So my main goal for this project is to have a problem, such as proving that AI isn't the main goal of voice acting, we're still here and being better, improved and advanced by AI  helping us and new technologies. So the next step is to find reasons why AI installs the deaf of voice acting.
# Skills
Skills while doing this blog is researching. Researching helped me with my project because it helped me see more reasons and angles on other perspectives on reasons why technology is helping voice acting, and not killing it. The more I read articles the more I see ups and downs about technology helping with voice acting whether its taking some other jobs or advancing someone's voice. This can help me navigate on what im trying to prove a point backing up anything at any time.

Another skill that helped me with this blog was definitely time management. It showed me the time I have for his blog and made me take notes on time management I have on a daily week. This helps me do stuff efficiently on homework like this.
# Summary
In the end of this blog I am realy excited on making this freedom project of making one of my top 3 future jobs can be edvance by technology instead of technology killing voice acting by explaining it into a good cause, showing people in the indistry matter and count because were the important part of voice acting.

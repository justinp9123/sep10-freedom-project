So far for my freedom project I research how some software and hardware in the voice acting industry can be more noticeable than before in today's world and show how it helps people in the industry. I have found Software/apps that had provided me with software that helps with voice acting/ over. The first thing I google searched was voice acting apps, then I found a website that I looked into : https://speechify.com/blog/voice-over-apps/. It shows apps/softwares that helps improve and helps people in the Industry.

The first one I viewed is called Easy Voice Recorder,It can help people who voice acts when they are on the go. It's only available on Android and iOS, it does not have a website but besides that, it can dictate text and record audio files at anytime

The second app I viewed was https://twistedwave.com/
Its available on online macOS, IPhone, and iPad’s
This apps helps produce high quality voice overs/acting 
Its a light weight editing software/app

The third app/software I researched through is Dropbox Screen Recorder
It can help people while they are at home doing work
It provides high quality audios while screen recording at home
Only available on desktops apps like Apple macOS, and Windows computer

Hardware:

* __Audio interference__
It transfers audio signals from a microphone into digital data for a computer so that it can create digital audio from it.
It can control over both inputs and outputs

* __Pop filter/Pop shield__
It is a filter on a microphone that reduces the popping sounds that occur in vocals such as saying “p” or “b”
Makes your audio/ voice over feel better in quality and sound more clean.

* __XLR Cable__
Transmits high-quality sound signals while effectively canceling out some unwanted electrical interference or noises.
Contains 2 signal pins to carey the same audio signal, one is positive and the other is a negative
Also contains 1 ground pin that acts like a shield

# Sources
All of this research for softwares/apps was from a website called https://speechify.com/blog/voice-over-apps/, in this website it has listed 7 apps that people use in the voice acting/over industry. It talked about how each app had a unique way people use them and how it can improve audio at its finest. This website has provided me with a lot of details to my main goal, which is to show how tech can help people in the field of voice acting/cover. It's very important to research everything on what I look up on to see whether it's real or fake.

# EDP
My current stage was to research on softwares/apps and hardwares that helps with the industry I chose for the freedom project, which is voice acting/over. For the plan being, I'm going to organize my research and sort them in order so that I can view things more easily in my blogs and for my freedom project, and from then on I'll finally be back on track with my work.
